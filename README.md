This project focuses on the Network Design, Service Deployment and Monitoring with the use of Openstack and various forms of Automation . It involves deployment and operating of services within an openstack cloud. The implementation involves three operating modes they are deployment, operation and cleanup. Deployment involves setting up of network infrastructure, routers,nodes and other components. The operation mode handles the number of nodes that present in the webserver which are requested and available. The cleanup mode releases all cloud resources that were in use. Deployment is done through using Ansible, Nginx, HAproxy, Prometheus. We provide a Monitoring solution to get the status of all nodes in the network.
